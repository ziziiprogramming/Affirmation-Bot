# ðŸŒ· Gentle Affirmation Bot ðŸŒ·
A **privacy-focused, student-built affirmation bot** created to promote positivity and practice **Responsible AI** principles.

This project applies skills from:
- **Cisco Cybersecurity courses** (data protection, safe storage)
- **Responsible AI** concepts (privacy-first design, ethical use)
- **Python programming** (file handling, encryption, random selection)

---

## Features
- **Default Affirmations** â†’ Ready-made positive quotes.
- **Community Mode** â†’ Share affirmations with others (stored locally, no internet upload).
- **Personal Vault** â†’ Write private affirmations stored securely with AES encryption.
- **Responsible AI Principles** â†’ Transparent storage, user control, privacy-by-design.

---

## Skills Demonstrated
- Python programming (`json`, `os`, `random`, `datetime`)
- Encryption using the [`cryptography`](https://pypi.org/project/cryptography/) library
- File handling & data persistence
- Menu-driven CLI design
- Ethical & responsible AI considerations

---

## Responsible AI & Privacy
- **Local Storage Only** â€” No cloud storage, no data sharing.
- **Encryption** â€” Personal affirmations are encrypted before being saved.
- **Transparency** â€” You can view, edit, and delete your data at any time.
- **Ethics** â€” No tracking, profiling, or AI-generated bias.
